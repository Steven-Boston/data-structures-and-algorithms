# Challenge 11: Pseudo-Queue via Stacks

Author: Steven Boston
Designed in Collaboration with: Joshua Haddock

Challenge 11 asks us to create a new Queue class implemented with stacks that offers the same functionality as a normal Queue, namely the two methods EnQueue and DeQueue.

## Approach & Efficiency

This implementation makes the best use of the available methods within the existing stack classes to keep a clean and efficient set of operations.

## Solution

The DuctTapeQueue class offers the following methods:

- EnQueue: Add to the end of the Queue
- DeQueue: Process a value from the beginning of the Queue.
