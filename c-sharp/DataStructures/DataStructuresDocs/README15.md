## Challenge

This data structure consists of a Binary Tree and an extension of it that forms a binary search tree. Both have access to several methods that assist in traversal, and the BST has two additional methods for populating as verifying the contents of the search tree. 

## Approach & Efficiency



## API

This implementation add two data structures:

DataStructures.BinaryTree<T>

- Node<T> Root
- PreOrder(Root)
- InOrder(Root) => 
- PostOrder(Root) => Array

DataStructures.BinarySearchTree<T> (extends BinaryTree)

- Add(T Value)
- Contains(T Value) => Boolean
